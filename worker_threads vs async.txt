async function - 
ie. 
(async function(){
  let i = 0;
  for(;i < 5000000000;i++){
    
  }
  console.log(i)
})()

JS seems to postpone the contents of the async function until the event loop starts.
they'll eventually run on the same main thread.
and if there was some heavy task like the above for loop, then the application will not be interactable until main thread is completes the task.

worker_threads - 
javascript was and is a single threaded programming language.
that being said a thread is nothing but a light-weight process.
so the way JS handle multi-threading is by creating a new process/a new virtual machine.
where the given task will run in parallel with the main thread.
note-
one cannot manipulate dom via worker threads, only main thread can do that.
and therefore some window object's properties and functions donot work in a worker thread
